# CPI-inflation


## 📊 CPI Inflation Analysis (India)

### Project Overview

This project analyzes **Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation trends in India** across Rural, Urban, and Combined (Rural + Urban) sectors over multiple years. The objective was to understand **inflation drivers, sectoral differences, and volatility patterns** across major consumption categories such as food, fuel, housing, health, and miscellaneous expenses.


### Dataset Description

*  Dimensions: Sector, Year, Month
* Categories Covered:

  * Food & Beverages (cereals, vegetables, milk, oils, pulses, etc.)
  * Pan, tobacco & intoxicants
  * Clothing & footwear
  * Housing
  * Fuel & light
  * Health, transport, education, personal care
  * **General Index** (overall CPI)
* **Granularity:** Monthly data across multiple years
* **Sectors:** Rural, Urban, Rural + Urban

---

### Analysis Performed

* Conducted **trend analysis** to compare inflation movement across sectors and time periods.
* Performed **urban vs rural comparisons** to identify structural differences in price behavior.
* Analyzed **month-over-month and year-over-year changes** to detect inflation volatility and anomalies.
* Evaluated **category-wise contribution** to overall CPI to identify key inflation drivers.
* Assessed stability of essential categories (food, fuel, housing) versus discretionary categories.


### Key Insights

* **Food & Beverages showed higher volatility**, especially in rural sectors, driven by seasonal price fluctuations in vegetables and pulses.
* **Urban inflation remained relatively stable** compared to rural inflation, particularly in housing and services.
* **Fuel and light exhibited sharp spikes** during specific periods, directly impacting the General CPI Index.
* Essential categories contributed disproportionately to overall inflation, highlighting **cost-of-living pressure on households**.
* Rural inflation was more sensitive to commodity price changes, while urban inflation was influenced more by services.
